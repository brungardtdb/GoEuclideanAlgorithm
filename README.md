# GoEuclideanAlgorithm
A program that uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the GFC between two numbers
The program uses the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder of a larger number divided by a smaller number.
The smaller number is then divided by the remainder and this pattern continues until the remainder is zero.
When the remainder is zero a greatest-common denominator has been found.
